# Introduction {-}

The words *Standardization and Balancing* are used for defining the process of combining commodity balances for creating Food Balance Sheets. Th FBS framework is defined in a dedicate document that explains all the steps for creating FBS starting from the initial data collection. The methodology of *Standardization and Balancing* is, then explained in a dedicate document. The process is based on a structured and clear set of relationships between commodities given by the, so called, *Commodity tree* which is also explained in a dedicated document. The *Standardization and Balancing* generates balances for FBS commodities at different levels of aggregation: by FBS item, by group, by family and Total (by country).
There are 3 main plug-ins connected to this process: 

 1. `pullDataToSUA` which created the input data-set for the process
 2. `Full Standardization and Balancing`, which performs all the steps of the process and saves data in different sessions on 3 different output data sets
 3. `printTree`. This plug-in performs the all process and saves the different outputs, plus some detail about commodity tree, extraction rates and shares, for a single *country-year-FBS item* combination. 
 
All documents describing different aspects of the process are listed here. Also links are reported to the documents.

# Food Balance Sheet workflow in the Statistical Working System

***Document Name and link***: [*01_StandDocs_FBSinSWS.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/01_StandDocs_FBSinSWS.pdf)


This documents presents the overall workflow for the production of Food Balance Sheet inside the SWS. The different SWS's objects involved in the creation of FBSs are presented and dependencies explained. 



# Standardization & Balancing for Food Balance Sheet Calculation

***Document Name and link***: [*02_StandDocs_Methodology.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/02_StandDocs_Methodology.pdf)

This document explains all the Standardization and balancing process from a methodological point of view. All steps are explained and formalized. No details are contained regarding the R script or the plug-in in the SWS. Methodology is presented here. 


# `faoswsStandardization`: `PullDataToSUA` plug-in
***Document Name and link***: [*03_StandDocs_PullDataPlugin.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/03_StandDocs_PullDataPlugin.pdf)

Pulling data inside the data-set that is the starting point for Standardization and Balancing: is the first step of the entire process. It is first introduced in the Document n.1 while document n.2 presents what has to be pulled. Here All steps for executing it in the sws are presented. The plug-in is a module contained in the *faoswsStandardization* package.

# `faoswsStandardization`: `Full Standardization and Balancing`. Data-sets content and plug-in execution
***Document Name and link***: [*04_StandDocs_StandardizationPlugin.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/04_StandDocs_StandardizationPlugin.pdf)


The plug-in for executing the *Standardization and Balancing* is presented here in all its steps. The plug-in is a module contained in the *faoswsStandardization* package.

# Standardization & Balancing: `Commodity Tree` dataset. Content and usage in the Food Balance Sheet framework
***Document Name and link***: [*05_StandDocs_CommodityTreeDataset.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/05_StandDocs_CommodityTreeDataset.pdf)

Commodity Tree is one of the most important data sets in the process of producing FBS. It is mentioned in all documents and briefly described. Here it is fully presented, together with some functions for validating its content, that are contained in the *faoswsUtil* package.

# `faoswsStandardization`: `Print tree` plug-in
***Document Name and link***: [*06_StandDocs_PrintTreePlugin.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/06_StandDocs_PrintTreePlugin.pdf)

This documents describes how to execute the `Print Tree` plug-in and its content. This plug-in produces a txt document containing all the tables related to the Standardization and Balancing, for a single FBS item. 

# Standardization & Balancing: `Utilization Table` data table. Data-table and Shiny App description

***Document Name and link***: [*07_StandDocs_UtilizationTable.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/07_StandDocs_UtilizationTable.pdf)

***Document Name and link***: [*06_StandDocs_PrintTreePlugin.pdf*]()

This documents describes how to execute the `Print Tree` plug-in and its content. This plug-in produces a txt document containing all the tables related to the Standardization and Balancing, for a single FBS item. 

# Standardization & Balancing: `Utilization Table` data table. Data-table and Shiny App description
***Document Name and link***: [*07_StandDocs_UtilizationTable.pdf*](https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/blob/master/documentation/New_Documentation_2018/07_StandDocs_UtilizationTable.pdf)

The Utilization Table is presented as a Data-Table in the SWS. 
Moreover, A shiny App exists for navigating in the data used for building the table. Description and links to the App are also given in this document.
